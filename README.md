## Getting started 🚀
To try it on your own run the following commands after you installed [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/):
```sh
yarn
yarn start
```
If you don't have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) installed, go ahead and do it. It's definitely worth it ;)
If you have [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), you also should run `nvm use v8` to use node version 8.X.X
## Live Demo 🎉
If you want to see how it currently looks like, you can go ahead and give it a visit via [https://firechattr.firebaseapp.com/](https://firechattr.firebaseapp.com/). This page is hosted on Firebase Hosting and should be updated. But please don't get driven crazy if something does not work. Everything is still under construction!
## About
FireChattr is a small PWA I build with Preact and Firebase to show how easy it is to connect Firebase's Firestore with MobX to Preact. Building the app took only two hours and after having it online I also wrote a medium.com article available [https://medium.com/@marius.niveri/lets-build-a-chatapp-1534d6b8df15](here) about how I did it.
